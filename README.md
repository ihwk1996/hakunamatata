## Problem
300 million people in the world are affected by depression.
Therapy sessions are the most effective tool to cure it, but there is a lack of therapists available. Technology should be used to provide more efficient care by making it more accessible and optimising the workload of therapists. 

## Soution
Our solution targets to provide easier access to care, improve the quality of the care while minimising load on therapists and lower costs of patients.
It is a 2 part approach, consisting of:
- Patient VR Solution
  - Speak to a VR therapist 24/7
  - Logs and recordings sent to therapist
  - Change map/avatar/music based of most preferred setting for comfort
- Therapist Web Portal
  - View patients' raw recordings and recordings converted to text
  - Use sentiment analysis to detect emotions and actions of the patient 
  - Track patients' progress remotely and cater for more targeted care during actual therapy session
  
## Moving forward
